				<p style="margin-top:0px">Pittsburgh is a city with one of the highest percentages of food insecurity in America. In this study, our team sought to learn more about the current situation and understand what it will take to solve this problem through contextual inquiries, expert interviews and affinity diagrams.</p>

					To eliminate food insecurity through education and affordable access.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="parttwo">
				<p class="paragraph">
					We began by reading up existing studies about food accessibility in Pittsburgh. Many organisations in Pittsburgh, such as JustHarvest and the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, have done great work studying and increasing accessibility to healthy food. In particular, <a href="http://www.justharvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/amenuforfoodjustice060713.pdf">A Menu for Food Justice</a> was an invaluable starting point for our own research.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					The initial problems we identified from this preliminary research fell under three broad categories: distance, limited transportation and poverty.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="partthree">
				<p class="paragraph">We reached out to a number of food banks and food kitchens in Pittsburgh for interviews. I was kindly allowed to visit the CHS Food Pantry and interview Mel Cronin, their coordinator.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">From our contextual inquiries, it became apparent that the problem was much larger than we had initially understood, consisting of many interconnected factors that all affect an individual's accessibility to healthy, fresh produce. Mel puts it best:
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph"><i>"Handing someone food is not solving issues... It is just a temporary band aid."</i>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="partfour">
				<p class="paragraph">Affinity diagrams help make sense of qualitative data gathered in the field. By organising and grouping interview notes by topic similarity, we were able to identify patterns in the experiences of our interviewees, key insights and possible design opportunities.</p>
				<img class="image" src="images/proj4 affinity.png">
				<p class="paragraph">What we initially thought were the main problems are now only components of a much larger picture. The real scope of the challenges that food bank clients face is much greater, and of these, we chose to focus on food literacy and employment.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="partfive">
				<p class="paragraph">Personas are archetypal users created to represent the individuals we design for, they provide realistic context and scenarios for how users will interact with proposed solutions.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">We made personas of the different types of customers we were designing for. These personas were based off the personal stories of the clients we spoke to.</p>

			</div>

			<div id="partsix">
				<p class="paragraph">Journey maps are visualised sequences of customer actions, organized into stages with customer feelings and frustrations at each stage mapped out. These maps helped us identify touchpoints and breakdowns that can be turned into design opportunities.</p>

			<div id="partseven">
				<p class="paragraph">
					Food literacy is about encouraging customers to choose healthy food and produce for themselves. When tackling this problem, we wanted to share the knowledge and experiences that many clients already have.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					Our proposed solution is for customers, when they collect their food, to receive blank recipe cards that they can then fill in with their own recipes. The cards are shared on the bulletin boards at food pantries and soup kitchens for other customers to see.
				</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="paragraph">
					This solution was created for clients like Gabrielle who visit the soup kitchen not just for food but also to socialize with their friends. As we found, the most effective food literacy education came from one-on-one conversations. We hope that such a solution will leverage on the existing communities at food pantries and soup kitchens to encourage customers to try new produce and new recipes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="parteight">
				<p class="paragraph">
					The problem of employment is particularly relevant to customers like Tyler and Patrick who have the capabilities to work but lack the opportunity. We wanted to propose a solution that helps them gain marketable skills while also returning them their sense of independence and security.
				</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="paragraph">
					Our proposed solution is a co-op program at the food bank; volunteers will help with the operations and in return, they will receive gift cards for grocery stores. Through working at the food bank, customers will gain experience managing, distributing and taking stock of the produce; these experiences can then help them in their job search. Additionally, food banks will also have a constant group of volunteers to help the work they do. It is our hope that this solution can thus benefit both clients and staff in the long-term.
