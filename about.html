							<p class="first">I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in Human Computer Interaction. My greatest passion is in user interface design; I aim to produce work that is visually appealing and seamlessly experienced. In order to better understand the users I design for, my second major is in Cognitive Science. Programming courses and prototyping courses have also helped me go beyond design to creating and testing my ideas.</p>

							<p>Currently, I am working on UI/UX design assignments for my courses and learning about rapid prototyping technologies such as 3D modeling and printing. I have previously worked as a teaching assistant for <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/">Introduction to Programming and CS (15-112)</a> for a year, teaching Python and data-mining. I am also familiar with C, JavaScript (with HTML and CSS) and the Adobe Creative Suite.</p>
