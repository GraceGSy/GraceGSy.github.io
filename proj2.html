				<p style="margin-top:0px">Mobile phone usage patterns over time can provide a wealth of data about user habits and preferences, but the availability of this data has had relatively little impact on the design of mobile user interfaces that improve the user experience by adapting to individual users.</p>
				<p style="margin-top:0px">The goal of this project is to identify design opportunities in every day apps where the UI can adapt to user habits to provide a more seamless interaction.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="partone">
				<p class="paragraph">
					Mobile app users can sometimes have repetitive patterns and habits in the way they use the app. Consider, for example, the customer who always uses their Starbucks app for payment when in a Starbucks store. It is inefficient for this customer to land on the general Starbucks page and spend extra time maneuvering to the payments screen every time. Instead, a responsive UI will learn that:</p>
				<p>
					"when this user is in a Starbucks store" -> "the user will need the payments screen".
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					This kind of repeated usage data is an unexplored source of information that can be used to create adaptive UIs that are customized to each user's unique habits, predicting user needs and thus reducing unnecessary steps.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="parttwo">
				<p class="paragraph">
					I first made some preliminary observations of the mobile apps people around me used frequently. In particular, I took note of situations where certain interactions with the UI could be predicted.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					One of the cases that I found striking, and which I chose to focus on, was the Forever 21 mobile shopping app. Users had to filter for their preferences each time they browsed a new category of items. None of these preferences were saved when users navigated away from a category, which means they sometimes had to input their sizes and color selections multiple times within the same session.

			</div>
			<div id="partthree">
				<p class="paragraph">Constant selection and re-selection of preferences is exactly the kind of repetitive interaction that adds little to the user experience. Since an individual's preferences, such as size and price range, are unlikely to differ much within the same browsing session, I felt that a shopping app can easily adapt and filter for these preferences automatically.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">The challenge is to communicate to the user that such an adaptation has taken place. Below are some initial mock-ups I created. The main idea was for the loading screen animation to indicate that user preferences are being filtered for.
				</p>
				<div class="gifs">
				<img id="gif1" class="image" src="images/proj2 loading 1.gif">
				<img id="gif2" class="image" src="images/proj2 loading 2.gif">
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="partfour">
				<p class="paragraph">The feedback I received was that the loading screen provided too little information about the preferences being filtered for. I created a new animation that more closely resembled the existing preferences selection interface.
				</p>
				<video width="400" controls>
					<source src="files/proj2 third.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				</video>
			</div>
			<div id="partfive">
				<p class="paragraph">Although the above loading animation design was informative about the preferences being selected for, it was time consuming and could be tiresome if viewed multiple times. I thus challenged myself to fit the entire loading animation in under 2 seconds.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">The following animation filters for color preferences in a little more than 1 second. Conceivably, size and price preferences can also be selected for with little additional time although those aspects are not animated here.
