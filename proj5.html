				<p style="margin-top:0px">PeerPresents is a web-based system that encourages students to provide peers with feedback during classroom presentations. The system is developed by Amy Shannon from the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at CMU. My work on this project included designing and implementing the front-end mobile interface of the system.</p>

			<div id="partone">
				<p class="paragraph">
					The PeerPresents online system allows presenters to ask questions and audience members to anonymously provide feedback in response. My role in this project is to redesign and implement the interface for mobile audiences.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="parttwo">
				<p class="paragraph">
					I began by wireframing the basic screens for a mobile interface. Audience members will first sign in with an anonymous nickname, before viewing and selecting which questions to comment on. Users can also reply to others' comments as well as agree/disagree with them.

						<p class="imageText">Initial wireframes of the mobile interface</p>

			<div id="partthree">
				<p class="paragraph">Feedback from the PeerPresents team included concerns that agree/disagree could be discouraging to users. We decided that this feature can be replaced by emoji reactions instead. I then created a new set of wireframes and conducted usability tests with them.</p>

					<img class="image" src="images/proj5 wireframe2.png">
					<div class="overlay">
						<p class="imageText">A second set of wireframes incorporating feedback from the PeerPresents team</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="paragraph">The user testing sessions revealed that having comments and replies to comments on different screens caused many users great confusion when navigating between questions and comments. Part of the difficulty was exacerbated by the small back button that was hard to locate.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Our team briefly considered collapsing comments and replies to comments into a single screen. However, we ultimately decided to defer implementing the feature of replying to comments. In the final wireframes (below), I changed the back button into a single large arrow at the side. Emoji reactions were also fully depicted and extraneous information, such as information about the presenter who asked the question, were removed.

						<p class="imageText">Final wireframes of the mobile interface incorporating feedback from usability tests and with some additional features</p>

			<div id="partfour">
				<p class="paragraph">I have since implemented the above mobile front-end interface for PeerPresents. The system is undergoing usability testing with students in the Building Virtual Course at CMU's Entertainment Techonology Center.</p>
