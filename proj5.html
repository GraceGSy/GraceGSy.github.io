				<p style="margin-top:0px">PeerPresents in a web-based system that encourages students to provide peers with feedback during classroom presentations. The system is developed by Amy Shannon from the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at CMU. My work on this project included designing and implementing the front-end mobile interface of the system.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="partone">
				<p class="paragraph">
					The PeerPresents online system allows presenters to ask questions and audience members anonymously respond to those questions. My role in this project is to redesign the interface for audiences, taking a mobile-first responsive design approach.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="parttwo">
				<p class="paragraph">
					I began by wireframing the basic screens for a mobile interface (below). Audience members will first sign in with an anonymous nickname, before viewing and selecting which questions to comment on. Users can also reply to others' comments as well as agree/disagree with them.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="partthree">
				<p class="paragraph">Feedback from the PeerPresents team included concerns that agree/disagree could be discouraging to users. We decided that this feature can be replaced by emoji reactions instead. I then created a new set of wireframes (below) and conducted user testing with them.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">The user testing sessions revealed that having comments and replies to comments on different screens caused many users great confusion when navigating between questions and comments. Part of the difficulty was exacerbated by the small back button that was hard to locate.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Our team briefly considered collapsing comments and replies to comments into a single screen. However, we ultimately decided to defer implementing the feature of replying to comments. In the final wireframes (below), I changed the back button into a single large arrow at the side. Emoji reactions were also fully depicted and extraneous information, such as information about the presenter who asked the question, were removed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="partfour">
				<p class="paragraph">Now that the design of the mobile interface has been finalised, I am currently working on implementing them in HTML and Javascript. Further user testing will be conducted to ensure full functionality after implementation.</p>
