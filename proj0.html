				<p style="margin-top:0px">Pocket Zoo is a mobile app created for the Yelp Design Challenge. The app aims to help families streamline the process of planning for a visit to the zoo so that everyone can have a leisurely, stress-free time at the zoo.</p>

					Going to the zoo is a fun family activity. Create an app that allows someone to plan their visit ahead of time.

					I began by performing an ecosystem collection (below) of what I already knew of zoos and visitor experiences. I then narrowed down the target audience to families (circled in green) and wrote down questions that I had (in red). This helped narrow the focus of my subsequent research to where there were gaps in my knowledge.

				<p class="paragraph">
					I interviewed three individuals who have recently visited a zoo with their family members. Interview questions included:
				</p>
				<ol class="paragraph">
					<li>Who did you visit the zoo with?</li>
					<li>Was the trip planned ahead of time? How much planning was done?</li>
					<li>Can you describe your experiences during the visit?</li>
					<li>How did everyone decide which exhibits to view?</li>
					<li>Was there anything that could have improved the visit?</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="paragraph">Interviewee profiles:</p>

				<p class="paragraph">Google Calendar</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Google Calendar is an app that comes with most Android devices and is commonly used to help individuals organize and plan activities in their day. I like the way busy schedules are presented clearly so that users always know what they have planned at any point in time.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, Google Calendar is used to keep track of a large diversity of events, thus the options available to customize each event to relatively complex. In comparison, planning for a zoo trip will likely include events/activities that are relatively similar, thus my app design can possibly simplify or abstract away many features on Google Calendar, such as repeating events or customizing location.</p>
				<img class="image" src="images/proj0 comp1.png">
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 50px">Trip Advisor</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Much like my app, Trip Advisor allows users to discover activities taking place at a certain location, and helps them plan for their trips.</p>
				<p>I like the efficiency Trip Advisor provides users by allowing them to book tickets, favorite and add an activity to a trip directly from the activity description page.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">Insight 1: Trips are structured around special events rather than permanent animal exhibits.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Many of my interviewees reported that during their trips, making time for special events (animal shows, feeding times) was higher on their priority list than viewing permanent animal exhibits. In fact, viewing permanent exhibits tended to scheduled around special events. This makes sense because special events are time sensitive while permanent exhibits allow for more flexible scheduling.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">As one of my interviewees, JL, shared, he and his parents looked at exhibits before rushing for a bird show that was held near the entrance of the park. Afterwards, they left despite not having completed their walk around the bird park because they did not want to retrace their earlier journey and look at the same animals again. This clearly illustrates not just the priority of special shows/events, but also the need to plan activities so that they fit together into a complete trip.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Insight 2: Most trips are free-and-easy with planning done impromptu at the zoo instead of being rigidly scheduled.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Most users prefer spending time leisurely with family instead of rushing to keep to a plan. Additionally, interviewee AN shared an experience where her father decided to spend more time at the white lion exhibit, which was a spontaneous decision that could not be accounted for ahead of time. This suggests that the app, while helping users keep track of the exhibits and events they want to visit, should not rigidly determine the timeline of their trip to the zoo.</p>
				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 50px">Storyboard</p>
				<img class="image" src="images/proj0 storyboard.png">
				<p class="paragraph">The above storyboard illustrates the general user journey of using the app:</p>
				<ol class="paragraph">
					<li>Rob decides to take his kids, Elise and Ethan, to the Pittsburgh Zoo that weekend.</li>
					<li>His kids are very excited. Elise really wants to see the cheetahs and watch the flamingo feeding time. Ethan doesn't care for flamingos, but wants to see the rhinos and fish.</li>
					<li>Rob is very confused by all these demands and decides to use the zoo's trip planner app. The app allows him to add events and exhibits to a plan, automatically organizing the best schedule of activities for him.</li>
					<li>Rob and his kids have a great family-bonding weekend at the zoo. Everyone loved visiting the animals they wanted to see.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div id="partfive">
				<p class="paragraph">I started by making some low-fi sketches to visualize different ways of organizing this app. Some variations included different menu layouts, the layout of individual event information, and the general flow of user interactions.</p>
				<img class="image" src="images/proj0 screens sketch.png">
				<p class="paragraph">I next created a small set of mid-fi screens to test out some elements of the app design. These screens prototyped 2 different menu layouts, a simple map of the zoo, and the process of adding events to and editing a plan.</p>
				<img class="image" src="images/proj0 initial screens.png">
				<p class="paragraph">Potential users who viewed the mid-fi screens agreed that the tab bar was a simpler and more intuitive navigational tool than the hamburger menu (1 and 2). One user reasoned that the app did not have enough navigational options to make the use of a pull-out hamburger menu necessary.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Users liked that the map tab included the option of mapping out the locations of events in a plan (4). Many felt that this would make it easier to estimate the amount of time they have to see permanent animal exhibits between events. Some felt that they would be better able to judge once the feature has been fully implemented.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">A minor related point was that most users found that the map (4) was too saturated, making it overwhelming to look at. Some users also felt that the logo bar was not informative enough and could do more in telling them what the app was for.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="partsix">
				<p class="paragraph">Working off the feedback received, I created a set of high-fi screens to mock up the complete experience of the app.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
				From my research, I found that zoo visitors are most interested in special events, thus the landing page of the app bring users directly to the Events tab. From here, users may tap on an event to find out more. Users can favorite an event from either page. Favoriting an event will also give users the option of adding it to a plan.
				</p>
				<img class="image" src="images/proj0 final1.png">
				<p class="paragraph">Users can manage their plans from the Manage Plans tab. They can tap on a plan to view it in detail. Special events (time sensitive) are displayed in green, while permanent exhibits that are added to the plan are displayed in purple. The app automatically suggests a suitable time in the plan a permanent exhibit can be visited, but users can drag a purple/permanent exhibit around to reorder its place in the schedule.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Plans do not need to have a date associated with it, but tapping on the Edit icon will prompt users to select a date for the plan. Users can also use the Edit button to edit the name of the plan.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Each event/exhibit has a delete button and a locate button. The locate button will bring users to the Map tab where they will be able to see the location of the event/exhibit. This is to help users plan their route with greater ease.</p>
				<img class="image" src="images/proj0 final2.png">
				<p class="paragraph">Finally, the Map tab leverages the in-built GPS capability of smart phones so users can search up exhibits and locate themselves within the zoo.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">More importantly, the Map tab also has the option of letting users map out locations of different events/exhibits in a particular plan (in example below, the plan called "Outing with Gran"). This feature is envisioned to address insight 2. By giving users a clear overview of the locations of the events/exhibits they really want to visit on a particular trip, users will be able to efficiently and flexibly decide which other exhibits they can visit enroute.</p>

			<div id="partseven">
				<p class="paragraph">The greatest shortcoming I see in 
				this project is the limited number of potential users surveyed during my research phase. While the design decisions I made were grounded in the data gathered from these users, I am conscious that they may not generalize well to the larger population who may have had more diverse experiences than the three individuals I interviewed.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Furthermore, this app assumes that the user is only planning to visit a single zoo. The app does not consider cases where a user may visit many different zoos in a period of time. However, I believe that the sequence of interactions prototyped above is generalizable to multiple zoos.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
				Given more time, I will like to conduct more robust user testings of my high-fi screens. Ideally, I will be able to ask potential users to complete think-aloud tasks using my prototype so that I may be able to identify places where the design is still lacking. Some things I am interested to find out include whether the concept of mapping a plan can be intuitively understood.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
				Additionally, I believe it will be most informative if I can conduct a contextual inquiry where a real user plans out and brings his/her family on trip to the zoo using the app prototype. I am interested to see whether the app makes scheduling events significantly easier and less stressful than the current experience.
